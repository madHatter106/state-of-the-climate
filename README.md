This project includes jupyter notebooks used to produce figures for the State of the Climate Reports 2017, and 2018.
Notebooks are in each year's ipynb directory. The directory includes mostly notebooks titled as (or similar to) "Making-Maps-X" 
and "Timeseries-X", where X is the step number, referring to a specific operation such as data organization or plotting. 
Other notebooks, if present, are experimental.
